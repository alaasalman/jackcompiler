jackcompiler: a toy compiler for the Jack programming language
=============================================

As part of the projects in the book The Elements of Computing Systems, a compiler is implemented for the Jack programming language. The Jack compiler and code generator is used as part of the projects while building the computer.

The tokenizer and parser generate xml files as an intermediate representation and for testing purposes. Sample Jack programs are also included in the repo.

I tried to follow the book as much as possible to help other readers, but when it made more sense I did my own thing.

Feedback is always welcome.

Installation
------------
The only requirement is a python installation. Any python 2.X > 2.5 should do.

Wishlist
----------
- better error reporting while tokenizing and parsing
- regular expression don't exactly follow the defined grammar, they're too general
